# Astromata

Welcome to **Astromata**, a game developed using the Godot 4.2.1 engine. Astromata is a work in progress. I want the game to be a marriage between Rimworld, Starbound and Stardew Valley.

- Godot Engine 4.2.1 installed on your system. Download it from [Godot's official website](https://godotengine.org/download).

### Installation

###### Clone this repository to your local machine:
